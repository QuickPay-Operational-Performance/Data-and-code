# Notation 

* Project $i$, Year-Quarter $t$
* $X_i$ denotes project level controls: initial duration, initial budget, number of offers received
* $\mu_t,\theta_{firm},\lambda_{task}$: Year-Quarter, Firm, and Product/Service code Fixed effects
* All continuous variables are winsorized at the 5\% level
$$ Treat_i = \begin{cases} 1, \text{ if project } i \text{ is a small business}\\
0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$
$$ Post_t = \begin{cases} 1, \text{ if year-quarter } t > \text{ April 27, 2011}\\
0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$

# Parallel Trends Test

Let $Time$ denote $q$-th quarter since the beginning of time horizon. For $Post_t =0$, we run the following regression:
$$ Delay_{it} = \alpha+\beta_0 Treat_i + \beta_1 (Treat_i \times Time) + \beta_2 X_i + \mu_t + \theta_{firm} + \lambda_{task} +\epsilon_{it}$$
The coefficient of interest is $\beta_1$. If this is significant, we would find evidence of a linear time trend before quickpay implementation -- violating the parallel trends assumption.

# Firm's rank order

* Consider a project $i$ of firm $f$ in quarter $t$.
* Let $\Pi_{f,2010}$ denote all projects of firm $f$ in Fiscal Year 2010. 
* Define $\rho_f = \sum_{i \in \Pi_{f,2010}} (Treat_i \times FAO_{if})/Sales_{f,\text{2010}}$.
* $\rho_f$ is the fraction of revenue a firm earned from small government projects in Fiscal Year 2010.
* Let $Rank_f = r(\rho_f)/N$ where $r(\rho_f)$ is the rank statistic of $\rho_{f}$ and $N = \text{number of firms}.$ For example, $r(\rho_f)=1$ if $\rho_f=\min(\rho_1,\rho_2,\ldots,\rho_N)$.
* Put simply, $Rank_f$ is a firm's rank order based on the fraction of revenue it earned from small government projects in FY 2010.

$$\begin{aligned} Delay_{it}&=&\beta_0+\beta_1 Treat_i + \beta_2 Medium_i+\beta_3 High_i +\beta_4 Post_t\\ && +\beta_5( Treat_i\times Post_t) + \beta_6(Medium_i\times Post_t) + \beta_7(High_i\times Post_t) + \epsilon_{it} \end{aligned}$$

# Firm's rank order [Vibhuti]

## Continuous model

* We have $\theta_{if} = Treat_i * Rank_f$

$$ Delay_{ift} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \theta_{if} + \beta_2 (\theta_{if} \times Post_t) + \beta_3 Post_t + \beta_4 Rank_f + \epsilon_{ift} $$

* Consider a firm with $Rank_f = k$. Then, we have
   * Large + Before = $\beta_0 + \beta_4 k$
   * Large + After = $\beta_0+\beta_3 +\beta_4 k$
   * Small + Before = $\beta_0+\beta_1 k + \beta_4 k$
   * Small + After = $\beta_0+\beta_1 k + \beta_2 k + \beta_3 + \beta_4 k$
   * Treatment effect: $\beta_2 k$

**Interpretation:** 

* Treatment effect is $\beta_2 k$ for a firm that received a proportion $k$ of its revenue from small projects. 
* In other words, for a firm earning $k$ proportion of revenue from small projects, Quickpay increased delays on small projects by $\beta_3 k$ days.

**Assumption:** Parallel trends between large and small projects of the same firm.

## Continuous Quadratic Model

* We have $\theta_{if} = Treat_i * Rank_f$

$$ Delay_{ift} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \theta_{if} + \beta_2 \theta_{if}^2 + \beta_3 (\theta_{if} \times Post_t) + \beta_4 (\theta_{if}^2 \times Post_t)+ \beta_5 Post_t + \beta_6 Rank_f + \epsilon_{ift} $$

* Consider a firm with $Rank_f = k$. Then, we have
   * Large + Before = $\beta_0 + \beta_6 k$
   * Large + After = $\beta_0+\beta_5 +\beta_6 k$
   * Small + Before = $\beta_0+\beta_1 k + \beta_2 k^2 + \beta_6 k$
   * Small + After = $\beta_0+\beta_1 k + \beta_2 k^2 + \beta_3 k + \beta_4 k^2 + \beta_5 + \beta_6 k$
   * Treatment effect: $\beta_3 k + \beta_4 k^2$

**Interpretation:** 
* One unit increase in rank $k$ increases treatment effect by $\beta_3 + 2k \beta_4$.

**Assumption:** Parallel trends between large and small projects of the same firm.

# Firm level analysis: 

* Treatment is now defined at the firm level.
* There is variation in the portfolio of small projects held by each firm
* We compare what happens to delays of a *firm* holding too many versus too few small projects once quickpay was implemented.
* Drawback: We cannot distinguish the effects for a given firm's large and small projects because of multicollinearity.

## Proxy 1: Revenue from small projects

* We defined $\rho_f$ as the share of revenue a firm received from small projects in fiscal year 2010.
* The numerator of $\rho_f$ is the sum of all federal obligations from small projects of a firm in fiscal year 2010. Because obligations can be negative, the sum can be zero or negative even if the firm held substantial number of small projects.
* In the previous section, we ranked the values of $\rho_f$. But this makes interpretation somewhat tricky. The minimum rank for each firm is now 1/N and it is never zero. What does a unit increase in Rank mean?
* An alternative can be to simply scale the values of $\rho_f$ to between 0 and 1. That is, for a firm A, we define $Share_A = (\rho_A - \min(\rho_f))/(\max(\rho_f)-\min(\rho_f))$. 
  * Suppose $\rho_A= -1,\max(\rho_f)=3,\min(\rho_f)=-2$. Then, $Share_A = (-1-(-2))/(3-(-2))=1/5.$ 
  * The max share will be 1 and min share will be 0.
* Setting aside measurement issues described earlier, we have:
  * $Share_f=0$ represents a firm getting no revenue from small projects.
  * $Share_f=1$ represents a firm getting its entire revenue from small projects.

### Continuous effect

$$ Delay_{ift}=\beta_0 + \beta_1 Share_f + \beta_2 Post_t + \beta_3 (Share_f \times Post_t)+\epsilon_{ift} $$

* Control is firm with $Share_f = 0$:
   * Before = $\beta_0$
   * After = $\beta_0+\beta_2$
* Treated firm with $Share_f = j$:
   * Before = $\beta_0 + \beta_1 j$
   * After = $\beta_0+\beta_2 + \beta_1 j +\beta_3 j$
* Treatment effect: $\beta_3 j$

**Interpretation:** For a firm that received a proportion $j$ of its revenue from small projects, delays after quickpay increased by $\beta_3 j$ days relative to a firm that received no revenue from small projects.

**Assumption:** Parallel trends for overall delays of treated and control firms.

* For better interpretation, in the regressions below, $Share_f$ is scaled to be between 0 and 100.
  * So we can interpret a one percentage point increase in $Share_f$

### Discrete effect

* Let $Share_f^{(k)}$ denote k-th tercile of $Share_f.$

$$ Delay_{ift}=\beta_0 + \beta_1 Share_f^{(2)}+ \beta_2 Share_f^{(3)} + \beta_3 Post_t + \beta_4 (Share_f^{(2)} \times Post_t) + \beta_5 (Share_f^{(3)} \times Post_t) + \epsilon_{ift} $$

* Control is firms in first tercile:
   * Before = $\beta_0$
   * After = $\beta_0+\beta_3$
* Treated firms in second tercile:
   * Before = $\beta_0 + \beta_1$
   * After = $\beta_0+\beta_1 + \beta_3 +\beta_4$
   * Treatment effect: $\beta_4$
* Treated firms in third tercile:
   * Before = $\beta_0 + \beta_2$
   * After = $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 +\beta_5$
   * Treatment effect: $\beta_5$

**Interpretation:** For a firm in medium range of revenue from small projects, delays after quickpay increased by $\beta_4$ days relative to a firm that received low revenue from small projects.

**Assumption:** Parallel trends for overall delays of treated and control firms.

## Proxy 2: Ratio of small projects

* For firm $f$, define $Share_f = \frac{\text{Num of small projects in FY 2010}}{\text{Total num of projects in FY 2010}}$.
* Same analysis as before but advantages:
   * Sample size: only firms excluded are new entrants to government projects.
   * No measurement problem. $Share_f$ will be zero for firms with no small projects, and one for firms with only small projects.
   * We can control for differences across firms through fixed effects. This will be less of an issue here because we will have enough observations.
