# Competition

## Impact on delays

Define
$$ SA_i = \begin{cases} 1, \text{ if project was signed after QuickPay}\\
0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$

$$ SB_i = \begin{cases} 1, \text{ if project was signed before QuickPay}\\
0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$

### Subsample model

For a subsample of competitive or noncompetitive projects: 

$$ \begin{aligned} RelativeDelay_{it} &=& \beta_0 +\beta_1 Treat_i+ \beta_2 SA_i+ \beta_3 Post_t \\&+& \beta_4 (Treat_i \times Post_t \times SA_i )+\beta_5 (Treat_i \times Post_t \times SB_i )+e_{it} \end{aligned} $$

* According to our hypothesis, $\beta_4$ should be positive and significant for competitive projects, and insignificant for non-competitive projects. 

* In the following regressions, we also control for the project's age. Project's age is defined as the number of quarters since it first showed up in the sample. We include the terciles of project's age as a control variable.

### Four-way interaction

We run the following model:

$$\begin{aligned} RelativeDelay_{it} &=& \beta_0 +\beta_1 Treat_i+ \beta_2 StartedAfterQP_i+ \beta_3 Post_t+ \beta_4 Competitive_i\\ && +  \beta_5 (Treat_i \times Competitive_i) + \beta_6 (Post_t \times Competitive_i)\\ && +  \beta_7 (StartedAfterQP_i \times Competitive_i) +\beta_8 (Treat_i \times Post_t)\\ && + \beta_9 (Treat_i \times Post_t \times Competitive_i) \\ && + \beta_{10} (Treat_i \times Post_t \times StartedAfterQP_i )\\ && + \beta_{11} (Treat_i \times Post_t \times StartedAfterQP_i \times Competitive_i) + e_{it} \end{aligned}$$

**Interpretation:**

* $\beta_9$ is the difference between treatment effect for competitive and non-competitive projects signed before quickpay.
* $\beta_9 + \beta_{11}$ is the difference between treatment effect for competitive and non-competitive projects signed *after* quickpay.
* $\beta_{11}$ is our coefficient of interest because it tells us how much of the difference is there due to "aggressive bidding" after the policy.
