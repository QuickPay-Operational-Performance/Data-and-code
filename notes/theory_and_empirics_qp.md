# Theory and Empirics: QuickPay 

$\tau$ : Payment timing

$T$: Project completion

## Theory 1: Payment timing & Project completion are strategic complements

> Hypothesis 1: QuickPay will result in shorter project lengths.

**Empirics**: Results don't support this theory in first implementation. Small business delays increased with faster payments.

## Theory 2: Role of Financial Constraints

> * For firms that are fully unconstrained or fully constrained, reducing $\tau$ will reduce T.
>
> * For firms that are moderately constrained, reducing $\tau$ *may* increase T.

**Empirics**: Results support greater delays for financially constrained firms than financially unconstrained ones. But financial constraint here is defined as an indicator.

* If we had data on annual revenue/number of employees etc., we could potentially distinguish between low, moderate, and full financial constraints by looking at terciles of these metrics. 

* Could potentially use sales data from Intellect?
  * But sales are a firm level metric whereas outcomes are project level 
  * Also large businesses will have higher sales but they also get more contract financing 
* Another way can be to compare outcomes of large and small businesses to study the impact of financial constraints 
  * Arguably small businesses on average are financially constrained but large ones are not
  * Also contractors don’t get to choose their categorization as a “large” or “small” business — it is decided according to revenue & number of employees within a given naics code

## Theory 3: Portfolio of Projects

1. Critical path argument
   * Likely difficult to test empirically since we don’t observe sequence of tasks involved in a project

2. Uncertain private project
   * May be able to test using Intellect data on sales and comparing with federal obligations
