**Figure 4. Avg. nonzero delay for small and large business projects over four consecutive quarters**



## Takeaways

1. Only use the first and last few quarters in the linear regression when we aggregate delays over more than 2 quarters.
2. Does not seem to have corrective behavior over time. The delay caused by QP seems to be persistent and maybe even slightly cumulates over time.
